This Arduino sketch implements a simple 4×4-keypad calculator with a 16×2 HD44780 LCD. It uses the Keypad and LiquidCrystal libraries to scan a matrix keypad, build two operands as strings, and perform +, −, ×, and ÷ when = is pressed. 
A small state machine routes digits to the first or second operand based on whether an operator has been selected; the second operand enables calculation. Inputs are converted to floats for arithmetic, with a divide-by-zero guard. 
The LCD shows the first number (and operator) on the top row and the second number on the bottom row, right-aligned like a real calculator; after evaluation it clears the screen and animates the result using `autoscroll`. 
The C key resets all state and clears the display. Wiring is configurable in the `rowPins/colPins` arrays (keypad) and the LiquidCrystal constructor (LCD).
